# Relucent Learning Hub

This learning "hub" is intended as a learn-along and a free resource constructed
during the constant learning process used while working. Whilst learning and
taking courses, this resource will continue to grow with notes based on learning
areas as they are approached in due course.

This section of the site is open-source and may become separated from its parent
"Relucent Accordion" site at some point, however, the resource will remain open-source
and accessible.

You are more than welcome to submit pull requests and add your own resources to this
repository and any issues or additional details that you think would be helpful within
resources is greatly appreciated.

## Considerations

This resource supports [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)-compatible Markdown and
runs as a submodule within a Docusaurus application. This section of the site is
intended to be open-source and can be freely copied or downloaded on to your own
machine. Other sections of its parent site are not open-source.
